# A flaw was found in the way Postgresql allowed a user to modify the behavior
# of a query for other users. An attacker with a user account could use this flaw
# to execute code with the permissions of superuser in the database. Versions 9.3
# through 10 are affected.
#
# Based on https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1834/
#
# The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all
# supported versions of the PostgreSQL database system, including 10.3, 9.6.8,
# 9.5.12, 9.4.17, and 9.3.22.
#
# We are in 9.6.9 
#
# Patch : https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/582edc369cdbd348d68441fc50fa26a84afd0c1a
#
# Already included in current version
